The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an issue where the expected behavior does not occur due to unexpected inheritance of properties, specifically the `font-size` property.  The `p` element within the `.container` class unexpectedly inherits a larger font size from the parent. 

```css
.container {
  font-size: 2em; /*This is the unexpected source of font-size inheritance*/
}

.container p {
  font-size: 1em; /*This should override but doesn't*/
  color: blue;
}
```
